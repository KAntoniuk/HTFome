#2.1. Overall design philosophy

The HTFome app was designed to provide biologists with a simple method of accessing data related to HTFâ€™s and the drugs that target them. The aim was to make it easy for a biologist to enter some parameters, such as a gene symbol, and quickly be provided with useful information about the relationships that gene has to other HTF genes, and to drug compounds. 

During development we were mindful that this app was never supposed to rival websites such as Ensemble, UniProt or ChEMBL in terms of data output, but instead to provide a small selection of biologically relevant data, and hyperlinks to the original data sources available.

The app is designed to be modular and scalable, to aid any future development efforts. Github was used throughout development to aid with version control and app releases.
