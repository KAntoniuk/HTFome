# 4. Areas for future development

Future development should focus on the database, changing from uploading the database directly, to hosting an SQL database server via AWS S3 and automatic database updates should be configured. The data input and models.py should be changed to allow the data to relate to each other via foreign keys/ ManytoMany fields. 

Another area to focus on developing further is combining the RShiny GEO data analysis with the Django web app, rather than linking to the GEO analysis, this should be available on htfome.com directly.
