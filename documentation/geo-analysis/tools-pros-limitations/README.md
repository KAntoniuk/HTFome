# 2.5.5. Tools: pros / limitations

The DoRothEA package has been created from curated literature and experimentally validated sources, which adds to the trustworthiness of the estimated protein activities that have been derived on the basis of these regulatory networks, as the relationships in these networks have been validated. Additionally, the quality of the resources as well as their diversity  can increase the accuracy of their computationally predicted relationships, which increases the apparent reach of the dataset, as it possibly could predict the protein activities based on relationships not yet confirmed by literature. However, as the HTF-targeted gene relationships isnâ€™t built from fully validated data only, this could potentially provide false estimates for protein activities. 

When looking through the data, it can be found that only around 1,300 HTFs are listed in the dataset, while other sources, such as UniProt, have upwards of 1,600 HTFs. This likely causes substantial miscalculations regarding the protein activities, as a lot of relationships are undoubtedly not accounted for.
