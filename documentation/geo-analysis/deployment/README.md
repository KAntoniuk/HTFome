# 2.5.4. Deployment

RShiny app can be deployed either with shinyapps.io, or by installing Shiny Server on a Linux server, such as AWS. Shinyapps.io method is simpler and it allows deploying an app straight from the RStudio on a local machine. However, this method has limited configuration options and needs all of the application system dependencies to be installed on shinyapps.io servers before deploying the app. Because some of the dependencies we need are not installed on a server, it is currently not possible to deploy our app with shinyapps.io. The solution to that problem might be requesting installation of those dependencies on https://github.com/rstudio/shinyapps-package-dependencies and waiting for a response. If added, it should be possible to deploy the app with shinyapps.io

The more advanced alternative is to set up a Shiny Server on a Linux server, such as AWS. This approach (unlike shinyapps.io) gives an option to install the required dependencies on a host server and gives more configuration options. However, setting up a server is much more complicated than with shinyapps.io and requires experience with Linux virtual machines. Installing shiny package and shiny server on linux can also be problematic. Therefore, filling a request for those dependencies to be installed on shinyapps.io servers and deploying the app there might be a more viable choice than setting up a dedicated Linux server.
