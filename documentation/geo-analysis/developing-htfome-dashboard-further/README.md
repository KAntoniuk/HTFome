# 2.5.6. Developing HTFome Dashboard further

To develop the dashboard further, smaller improvements and bug fixes could be made such as:

- Adding more validation (e.g. testing to verify GDS format for an uploaded file, testing to check for an empty file).

- Colour data by sample types (to make PCA and HCA outputs more informative).


Further larger features could be added, for example:

- Deploying the app online (currently we are unable to deploy the app to shinyapps.io as the server lacks the dependencies we require).

- A tab item within the dashboard to allow the user to view a volcano plot visualising the differential gene expression analysis.

- Making plots fully interactive by plotting using plotly or other interactive visualisation tool.

- Adding a download button so users can download their analysis as reports.
