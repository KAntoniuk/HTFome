# 2.2. Django web-framework:

The project itself is developed predominantly in Django, a python-based framework for creating web appâ€™s. Initially we opted to use the Flask framework, partially as we were more familiar with webapp development with this framework, and also because Flask is recognised as a micro-framework, perfect for developers who are new to web apps, although there is some compromise between built-in features and overall design flexibility.

We switched from Flask to Django for several reasons, firstly Django includes several useful features missing from Flask, which make development easier, such as a built-in administration system and a database ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper). Django is also more scalable, Django releases have forwards-compatibility in mind and within a Django project there can exist multiple apps, which allows for more modular development, as well as the ability to copy and repurpose apps later in production. 

In our experience working with both frameworks, Django seemed a more logical choice for this particular project, however this is no criticism of Flask, and Django does have some drawbacks, discussed below.
